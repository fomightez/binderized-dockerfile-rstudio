# RStudio in Binder using a Dockerfile

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fomightez/dockerfile-rstudio/master)

This deploys a Binder that exposes the
RStudio UI instead of a Jupyter Notebook. It also installs
several packages from the tidyverse, and includes a demo
script to show off functionality.  Plus some items for bioinformatics. Several I was unable to install via the Dockerfile.

To start your RStudio session, click on "new" in the top right,
and at the bottom will be `RStudio Session`.
Click that and your RStudio session will begin momentarily!

See `instructions.ipynb` for more details.

RStudio support with JupyterHub*
